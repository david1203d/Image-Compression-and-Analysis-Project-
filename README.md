# Image-Compression-and-Analysis-Project-
This project encompasses a suite of MATLAB functions designed for the compression and analysis of images through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It aims to explore the application of these mathematical techniques for reducing image storage space while minimally impacting image quality.
